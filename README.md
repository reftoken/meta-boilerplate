# Boilerplate meta repo

## How to get started

1. Install meta: `npm i -g meta`
2. Clone this repo with the special meta git clone command: `meta git clone git@github.com:reftoken/meta-boilerplate`

This will clone this repo and the repos defined in the `.meta` file. If any additional repos are added later, run `meta git update` to clone them as well.
